### Case sensitivity of tag names

Since logback version 0.9.17, tag names pertaining to explicit rules are case insensitive. For example, `<logger>`, `<Logger>` and `<LOGGER>` are valid configuration elements and will be interpreted in the same way. Note that XML well-formedness rules still apply, if you open a tag as `<xyz>` you must close it as `</xyz>`, `</XyZ>` will not work. As for implicit rules, tag names are case sensitive except for the first letter. Thus, `<xyz>` and `<Xyz>` are equivalent but not `<xYz>`. Implicit rules usually follow the [camelCase](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CamelCase) convention, common in the Java world. Since it is not easy to tell when a tag is associated with an explicit action and when it is associated with an implicit action, it is not trivial to say whether an XML tag is case-sensitive or insensitive with respect to the first letter. If you are unsure which case to use for a given tag name, just follow the camelCase convention which is almost always the correct convention.
