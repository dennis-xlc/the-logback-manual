## What is logback?

Logback is intended as a successor to the popular log4j project. It was designed by **Ceki Gülcü**, log4j's founder. It builds upon a decade of experience gained in designing industrial-strength logging systems. The resulting product, i.e. logback, is faster and has a smaller footprint than all existing logging systems, sometimes by a wide margin. Just as importantly, logback offers [unique and rather useful features](https://logback.qos.ch/reasonsToSwitch.html) missing in other logging systems.
