## Logback's architecture

Logback's basic architecture is sufficiently generic so as to apply under different circumstances. At the present time, logback is divided into three modules, `logback-core`, `logback-classic` and `logback-access`.

The _core_  module lays the groundwork for the other two modules. The _classic_ module extends _core_. The _classic_ module corresponds to a significantly improved version of `log4j`. Logback-classic natively implements the [SLF4J API](http://www.slf4j.org/) so that you can readily switch back and forth between logback and other logging systems such as `log4j` or `java.util.logging` \(JUL\) introduced in JDK 1.4. The third module called _access_ integrates with Servlet containers to provide HTTP-access log functionality. A separate document covers [access module documentation](https://logback.qos.ch/access.html).

In the remainder of this document, we will write "logback" to refer to the logback-classic module.

## Logger, Appenders and Layouts

Logback is built upon three main classes: **Logger**, **Appender** and **Layout**. These three types of components work together to enable developers to log messages according to message type and level, and to control at runtime how these messages are formatted and where they are reported.

The **Logger** class is part of the logback-classic module. On the other hand, the **Appender** and **Layout** interfaces are part of `logback-core`. As a general-purpose module, `logback-core` has no notion of loggers.

Loggers are named entities. Their names are case-sensitive and they follow the hierarchical naming rule:
```
Named Hierarchy
A logger is said to be an ancestor of another logger if its name followed by a dot is a prefix of the descendant logger name. A logger is said to be a parent of a child logger if there are no ancestors between itself and the descendant logger.
```
